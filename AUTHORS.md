## Who was/is responsible for what?

Mind you, this is not precise enough for pointing fingers at anyone (only one (two?) of us was using RCS back in the day anyway), but more a general historic overview through a soft-focus lense. Part *fact*, and where evidence and memory failed these grey hairs<sup>\[i_a\]</sup>, *alternative facts* have been injected to complete the story.
  
- Hans Wessels: all compression and decompression engine work. MC68K optimization work. Number One.
- Wout Klaren & Ric Klaren: GUP application code + overall code portability work. When it's C++, here's whodunnit.
- Wout Klaren: GUP GUI for AtariST (GEM)
- Ric Klaren: autoconf work
- Erick Silkens: MSWindows port back in the day. Pre Y2K Win GUI. (this code is now largely obsoleted, alas.)
- Ger Hobbelt: UNARJ port to AtariST. unArjBeta 'dump mode' work, fruity commandline parsing, cross-platform porting, general non-super-specialist blather and misc shizzle.
