## Who was/is responsible for what?

- Hans Wessels: all compression and decompression engine work. MC68K optimization work.
- Wout Klaren & Ric Klaren: GUP application code + overall code portability work. When it's C++, here's whodunnit.
- Wout Klaren: GUP GUI for AtariST (GEM)
- Erick Silkens: MSSWindows port back in the day. Pre Y2K Win GUI. (this code is now largely obsoleted, alas.)
- Ger Hobbelt: UNARJ port to AtariST. unArjBeta 'dump mode' work, enhanced commandline parsing, cross-platform porting, general non-super-specialist blather and misc shizzle.
